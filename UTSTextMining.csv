If you want to gain the most experience possible, please do hire a guide there. For only several tens of thousand rupiahs you'll get complete inside knowledge of the place. Careful for the restricted spaces though, they have cameras."

Lawang Sewu,Faisal Sangaji,5.0,"One of the tourist sites that you have to visit when you are in the semarang city, central Java Capital, especially to those of you who enjoy historical landmarks. Lawang Sewu often switched functions since it woke up in the Dutch colonial era as the colonial office of the Japanese later on as a prison house and early in the freedom of Indonesia became a railway station. The place is clean and you can visit from morning to night so it's quite appropriate if you want to feel night at the museum atmosphere. Affordable ticket prices for children and adults.

Lawang Sewu,Cindy Yanci,5.0,"The building is very very complex with tons of rooms and door after door leading to another. It has a basement that looks like a dungeon and if you come here, dare yourself to go up to the attic. There's nothing in the attic but.. the bats. It's a very large complex so prepare yourself. It has many rooms but most of them are just empty rooms with historical posters about Indonesian train stations, trains, and Semarang itself. There's one spot that you should definitely take a photo of yourself there, it has pretty colorful mosaic windows, you will feel like you're in a European style church.

The building has 4 different building are building A & B the bigger building in the area and the smaller building are C & D. In 1942, Japanese army took over and turned the building dungeon B as underground prisons it supposedly serves as a water reservoir in Dutch era. And the sad stories began.

The other prison were 16 standing room size jailed 1 x 1 meter for 5-8 prisoners. And railway to the exit had executions room.

Lawang Sewu,Ivan Febriand Muhammad,5.0,"Lawang Sewu is a historic building in Indonesia located in Semarang City, Central Java. This building, which used to be the office of the Nederlands-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij or NIS. It was built in 1904 and completed in 1907. It is located at the Tugu Muda circle which was formerly called Wilhelminaplein. Local people call it Lawang Sewu because the building has so many doors, despite the fact that the number of doors does not reach one thousand. This building has many windows that are tall and wide, so people often think of it as a gate. This old building is the location of a great battle between the AMKA youth or the Train Youth Force against Kempetai and Kidobutai, Japan. Therefore the Semarang City Government includes Lawang Sewu as one of 102 ancient or historic buildings in the city of Semarang that are worth protecting. Currently the old building has undergone a stage of conservation and revitalization carried out by the Unit Preservation of objects and historic buildings of PT Kereta Api Company. During the Japanese occupation in 1942, the basement of the Lawang Sewu building was formerly a drainage channel but was converted into an underground prison as well as a drainage channel. This building is also a silent witness to the fierce battle between the people of Indonesia and the Japanese army, known as the Battle of Five Days in Semarang. This underground jailis is a witness to the torture and massacre of Indonesian people, which was carried out by the Japanese army at the time of forced labor or romusha. The atmosphere in this place makes the hair stand on end, especially when entering a corner of a narrow room shaped like small pools that were used as prisoners."

They painted their house walls and streets with a colorful paint like a rainbow and some mural too. It's so instagramable. But i give an average rating because it's basically just an usual village with rainbow color. We can go around the village and nothing to do. Maybe if there any kind of traditional art market or something like that, that can add value to the village."

Kampung Pelangi,Rob S,3.0,"Kampung Pelangi or also known as ""Rainbow Village"" is an assortment of houses, shops and a roadside market decorated with vast and varying but ultimately fading colours. The attraction suffers from poor parking management and poor cleanliness (at times), with an unfortunate stench emanating from the river that runs through it and misconstruction of certain sewage systems. Don't get me wrong it can be very picturesque and there are plenty of flowers (for any couples or lovers out there) with the added bonus of being able to order flower message boards there. Pros: Looks decent for an Indonesian tourist destination Has a fun market filled with lots of goodies Toilets are accessible & free Cons: Suffers from mismanagement (Smelly!)"

Wilis Park,Alfian Rheza Arjuna,2.0,"(Translated by Google) I took the photo around January 6, 2022 . Taman Wilis may not be very popular because of its 'hidden' location from public roads, but the environment is suitable for cycling or morning exercise, the view is also good when you meet the sunrise. at night we are presented with a view of the city of Semarang from there. but it turned out that the last time I was there the condition was very bad, not maintained & dirty. I undo the intention to just hang out there. . please for the parties concerned who read my review can rearrange the garden wilis to be more 'decent'. (Original) saya ambil foto sekitar tanggal 06 Januari 2022 . taman wilis mungkin tidak terlalu populer melihat lokasinya yang 'tersembunyi' dari jalanan umum, namun lingkungannya cocok untuk sekedar bersepeda maupun berolahraga pagi, pemandangannya juga bagus saat bertemu sunrise. dimalam hari kita disuguhkan pemandangan kota semarang dari sana. namun ternyata saat terakhir saya kesana kondisinya sangat jelek, tidak terawat & kotor. saya urungkan niat untuk sekedar nongkrong disana. . tolong bagi pihak yang terkait yang membaca ulasan saya dapat menata ulang taman wilis agar menjadi lebih 'layak'."
Wilis Park,Fitria Indri,5.0,(Translated by Google) The place is comfortable. Not bad. You can see the view of Semarang from up here. Most like when a new plane takes off. I like the atmosphere. The lack of this place is a lot of garbage scattered around. Inadequate trash cans. So it's a little less beautiful to look at. Thanks (Original) Tempatnya nyaman. Bagus juga. Bisa liat pemandangan semarang dari atas sini. Paling suka saat momen ada pesawat baru take off. Tmbah suka sama suasananya. Kurangnya tempat ini banyak sampah berserakan. Tempat sampah kurang memadai. Jadi agak sedikit kurang indah dipandang. Makasih

This park offers a partial view of the city of Semarang. Many visitors are crowded at night just to enjoy the scenery and the light gusts of wind. The best time to enjoy the scenery in this park is when the sun rises (sunrise) and the atmosphere at night, especially the full moon. In this park there is also a vendor who sells various snacks, cup instant noodles, and drinks as friends to enjoy their time here. (Original) Taman ini berada di jalan wilis belakang RS Elizabeth Semarang. Pengunjung tidak dikenakan tiket masuk maupun parkir. Taman ini menyajikan sebagian pemandangan kota Semarang.

Wilis Park,sinz 77,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is quite beautiful ... at night or at sunrise. The location is also easy to find. Pass in front of Elisabeth Hospital, head north. If the place is hot this afternoon, because there are no trees that are shady enough to shelter. Just a suggestion if you want to go to this location better in the morning at sunrise, or at night, because at night the badge will light up and the view of Semarang city lights will look beautiful. (Original) Tempatnya lumayan indah.. kalau malam hari atau saat matahari terbit. Lokasi juga mudah di temukan. Lewat depan RS Elisabeth, menuju ke arah utara. Kalau siang tempat ini panas, karena tidak ada pepohonan yg cukup rindang untuk berteduh.

Wilis Park,Rifqi Fakhrur,3.0,"(Translated by Google) Taman Wilis is a park located near Elisabeth Hospital. The location of Wilis Park is very easy to reach, just go through Elisabeth Hospital and then the 600 meter road we will arrive at Wilis Park. This park presents a beautiful view of the city of Semarang. At night we visit this park, then we will find flickering lights in urban areas ranging from lights of buildings and vehicles and also not to forget the beautiful moon and stars. When I visited this place, I felt that it was not in line with expectations. My expectations of this park are vast and there are many facilities. It turned out that after arriving at the location it turned out that Taman Wilis was not so wide, there were only seats, small parks and buildings that were commonly used as photo spots. (Original) Taman Wilis merupakan taman yang berada didekat Rumah Sakit Elisabeth. Lokasi Taman Wilis sangat mudah dijangkau, cukup melalui Rumah Sakit Elisabeth lalu jalan 600 meteran nanti kita akan sampai di Taman Wilis. Taman ini menyajikan pemandangan indah Kota Semarang. Dimalam hari kita berkunjung ke taman ini, maka kita akan menjumpai kerlap-kerlip lampu di perkotaan mulai dari lampu gedung-gedung maupun kendaraan dan juga tak ketinggalan indahnya rembulan serta bintang. Saya ketika datang mengungjungi tempat ini merasakan ketidak sesuaian ekspektasi. Ekspektasi saya terhadap taman ini itu luas dan ada banyak fasilitas. Ternyata setelah sampai dilokasi ternyata Taman Wilis tidak begitu luas, hanya ada tempat duduk, taman kecil dan bangunan yang biasa dipakai spot foto."

Wilis Park,Benny Pudjiastanto,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The park which presents a view of the class gap between the lower economy class and the upper & middle economic class in the city of Semarang. In the south & west the park has a luxurious house in the hills, while in the east there is a view of dense settlements, of course not forgetting high rise buildings that began to appear in the city of Semarang. This park is one of the cleanest parks in the city of Semarang, perhaps because there are not many visitors, considering its location which is somewhat hidden from the main road. For those who are tired of waiting for sick relatives at Elisabeth Hospital, they can refresh themselves for a while, because the distance is only 5 minutes on foot. Also in the park there is also free Wi-Fi. Because it's still new, the tree isn't shady enough, especially in the circular garden bench. We see a few more years. (Original) Taman yg menampilkan pemandangan kesenjangan kelas antara kelas ekonomi bawah dengan kelas ekonomi menengah & atas di kota Semarang. Di selatan & barat taman ada rumah mewah di perbukitan, sementara di sebelah timur ada pemandangan pemukiman padat, tentunya tidak lupa gedung tinggi yg mencuat mulai bermunculan di kota Semarang. Taman ini salah satu taman di kota Semarang yang paling bersih, barangkali karena tidak banyak pengunjung, mengingat lokasinya yang agak tersembunyi dari jalan utama.
